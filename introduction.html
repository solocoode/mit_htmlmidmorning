<h1 style="color: red">Safari Mid-Morning class</h1>
<p>This is my first Html class. I have been able to learn tags.</p>
<p>Most tags have an opening and closing tag. Some however don't.</p>
<p>lorem inputs and fills a paragraph with random words and act as a placeholder as shown below.</p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consecrate radicalising elite. At et magnum, minima necessitates sit veritas? Commodity
  dolor deque fugit senescent provident quid quits squamous cisgendered, sit total? Commodity, ipsa, ipsum.</p>
<hr>
<h1 style="color: deeppink">Content</h1>
<p>Information stored inside the tag brackets is called an attribute.</p>
<p>Information inside the tags is called an element.</p>
<p>A doctype is a declaration of the version of Html being used. The above doctype declares that this is Html 5.</p>
<p>(Lang=en)is an attribute whose function is just to tell us what language we are coding the website in.</p>
<p>The (head) contains important information about the website . This is where the metadata is kept amd read.
It is also where the style is coded in the case that there is no css page.</p>
<p>(Title) is used to store how the website is to be called.</p>
<p>(Body) contains the information in the website itself.</p>
<p>(hr) tags are used to separate the website into segments or sectors.</p>
<p>Meta tags are used to adjust the website as follows.</p>
<p>(meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge")This makes our website compatible with all available browsers.</p>
<p>(meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0")
  This enables the website to automatically adjust accordingly to the type and size of the device being used to access it.</p>

<h1 style="color: orange">THE MATRIX</h1>
<p> The Matrix is a figurative mental Alcatraz that has been imposed on the free citizens of the world by
the very people who most put in positions of power to serve them through organisations like the government.</p>
<h1 style="color: turquoise">What is the matrix?</h1>
<p>Those in power always want to retain their power till death do them part. As a result, they created the matrix
with the aim of imprisoning  the most powerful machine in the world and create a world of willing and free slaves
  to serve them as they seat in their high offices. Many claim this came with the advent of capitalism, but I personally
think it came about even before we were a decent civilisation, back when it was all about natural selection in a man eat
man environment.</p>
<h1 style="color: #9a470a">Thinking of escape.</h1>
<p>Just like Alcatraz it is quite an impossible journey to escape the Matrix. This is not to imply that it is not however possible.
Against all odds many have tried but few have succeeded. Many describe it as a suicide mission due to the complexity
of the exit route. This however makes it more appealing to those with an entrepreneurial spirit and the last
resort to those with free will.</p>
<h1 style="color: darkblue">Escape from the matrix.</h1>
<p>Many self-proclaimed rip-offs have put up suggestions and theories on how to escape but only one way has proven right.
It follows principles like garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<h1 style="color: #e70808">Where there is a will there is a way.</h1>
<p>The first step is delete. Delete all you have been told and taught and reformat your brain of all toxic habits, beliefs and practices.
Without this step everything else is in vain. It is vital to empty the system before you can input more information.</p>
<p>The second is to be selective.Choose wisely and intuitively what you ingest. We live in the information age hence it is now easier than ever to
access information through various modes of media. What you ingest is what you become.</p>
<p>Third is internalize. After consumption and analytical observation of the core principles and patterns of life, internalize and make it part
of who you are as an entity.</p>
<p>Fourth is action. Faith without action is dead. Let me be clear and emphasize that we are not anti-government group like the
Anarchists are. We are, however, an independent non-governmental organisation that aims to liberate as many people as
  possible form the clenches of the one with long arms.</p>
<p>Fifth is continuity.This is like a pledge one cannot dream to break. I mean you literally changed your whole lifestyle
and put in so much effort. It is not only fair bot also reasonable to live this lifestyle with utmost continuity and devotion.</p>
<p>After all these steps being followed to the letter and with the freedom of creativity to allow for uniqueness, I am confident
when I say that one will experience a euphoric emotion of freedom and genuine joy that last a lifetime.</p>
<hr>
<h1 style="color: blue">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion it  is quite clear that change is needed. The will to change is found within and takes a lot of courage
to go through with it. This however does not imply that it is impossible. One however does expect a lot of challenges
  and oppositions that come with a lot of  wrath. This opposition is going to originate from peers anf loved ones who have been
brainwashed as well as from the 'almighty powerful' ones.</p>
